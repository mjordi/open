# This is a sample CODEOWNERS file. Replace the following with your actual owners.
# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, they will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.

# Example: Assign specific owners for specific files or directories
# /path/to/file @owner1 @owner2
